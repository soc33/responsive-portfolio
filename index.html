                Growing up in the panhandle, without much to do, I always had a yearning to learn new things. I moved to Orlando in 2010 for college and became a UCF grad with a bachelors in Elementary Education. Although I loved teaching the things I loved to learn to others, the teaching profession left me wanting more. I turned back to learning more on my own, trying to find things to satisfy my mind with new knowledge and problem solving activities. This is what brought me to coding.

                In fall of 2017 I happened upon an ad for the UCF coding bootcamp. I immediately began the process of admission thinking I had found my new career, but due to unforseen financial circumstances I was unable to join the program until a year later in the fall of 2018. During this time I searched some coding opportunities on my own learning some basics but not getting too far. Once I joined the program I have been continually excited about the growth in new knowledge. Further solidifying that this is what I truly want and need to do with my life.

                It has so far been challenging but at the same time rewarding and I cannot wait to see what else I can accomplish!
